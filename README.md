## How to Compile the Game

To run the game you will need University of Canterbury Fun Kits Version-4 ([UCFK4](https://checkout.canterbury.ac.nz/cart.php?action=buy&sku=1000200&source=buy_button "UCFK4 in Store")) and the approate cable ([USB Mini-B](https://checkout.canterbury.ac.nz/cart.php?action=buy&sku=1000201&source=buy_button "Cable in Store")). 

This game is compiled using the **gcc-avr** compiler and needs certain required packages. To install these packages ensure you are running a **Linux** distribution and run the following command in the console. Also, the game uses modules that can be found in the [UCFK4-Git-Repository](https://eng-git.canterbury.ac.nz/rmc84/ence260-ucfk4.git "UCFK4 Git").

```Console
sudo apt-get install git gcc-avr binutils-avr avr-libc dfu-programmer
```

If there are problems when compiling you may also need to create a ***udev rule*** in order to allow access to the USB ports. To do so run the following command in the console.

```Console
sudo -i
  echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="03eb", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2ff0", GROUP="plugdev"' > /etc/udev/rules.d/52-bootloadDFU.rules ; exit
```

From within the same directory as the [Game files](./ "Main Directory"), the following command can be run to compile the game code.

- `make`: This will compile the source code and builds object files based on the **[Makefile](./Makefile)**.

For optional tidiness you can run the following.

- `make clean`: This will remove old object files from the directory.
